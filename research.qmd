My research interests are focused on developing methodologies in spatial statistics and computer model simulations. I am working in a wide array of areas from environmental and earth sciences as well as with engineering statistics. Specific areas that I have been working on include surrogate modeling, design of experiments and inverse problems. I am currently working on developing a methodology for spatio-temporal binary/multinomial variables in a point-referenced context, and on a separate project that focuses on developing a spatial verification scoring rule for meteorological forecasts with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
