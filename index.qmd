### Quick bio

I am Romain Boutelet, a fourth year PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Probability at Michigan State University. I am very grateful to be advised by [Dr. Chih-Li Sung](https://chihli.github.io/){target="_blank"}, and to be part of the [Finley Lab](https://www.finley-lab.com/){target="_blank"} under the supervision of Dr. Andrew Finley.

My research interests include Computer Experiments and Uncertainty Quantification in the broad context of Engineering Sciences as well as Spatial Statistics.
